We will use the center of each suburb to check for the number of establishments that represent a direct competition to our franchise. \n\n### As from the possible Foursquare Venue Categories ( documented at: https://developer.foursquare.com/docs/build-with-foursquare/categories/ ) we will consider as direct competition the categories: Bakery, Cafeteria, Creperie and Donut Shop.\n\n\n### The final objetive of the data analysis is to provide a quantitative evaluation of the best suburbs (considering them from their geographical center) to have insight on where to open franchise establishments."
